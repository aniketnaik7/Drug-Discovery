- To predict the bioactivity of a molecule against the target protein Acetylcholinesterase, excess amounts of which cause neurodegenerative disorders.
levels of gene expression due to excess cell division.

- Preprocessing_and_EDA.ipynb - To process the data properly and perform and Exploratory Data Analysis. Cleaned the SMILES notation and calculated the Lipinski descriptors.
- Comparing_Regression_Models.ipynb - Split the data into the train and test sets and compare the performance of different regression models
